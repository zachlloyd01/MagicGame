His dominating performance at this year's World Championships earned him that title at lost. Finkel played an explosive deck that is named after its most important card, Tinker. Fellow Team Antarctica member Dan O'Mahoney-Schwartz designed this monoblue deck. The deck used artifacts such as Grim Monolith, Metalworker, and Voltaic Key to quickly generate huge amounts of mana, and then used that mana to put large creatures into play.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc00","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2000","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/632741a4-411d-4110-b507-5a5cfdd52ef2","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc00&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc00?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/de9d6766-2b3c-4215-858b-5205702cbc8e/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A8a14f83d-2eed-46c3-b9a5-e0e55bbd7a66&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"056eb595-ee96-4682-9206-1eaba1e88719","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Jon+Finkel+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Jon+Finkel+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Jon+Finkel+Bio"}}
