He placed second at Pro Tour™—Los Angeles and finished in the Top 16 at Grand Prix—San Francisco, his hometown. Ben played the archetypal mono-red weenie or Sligh deck at the 1998 Worlds. Although he prefers to play a more balanced deck, Rubin thought the aggressive Sligh would work well at this tournament. His deck consists of roughly one-third land, one-third direct damage, and one-third small aggressive creatures.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc98","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1998","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc98&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc98?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/06e4ce71-a557-4a05-a163-9f28b8f6479b/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A5f03c43b-292f-42b5-915c-43bb4429ed6f&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"df9a3149-dae5-4319-85bb-00d37c023360","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Ben+Rubin+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Ben+Rubin+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Ben+Rubin+Bio"}}
