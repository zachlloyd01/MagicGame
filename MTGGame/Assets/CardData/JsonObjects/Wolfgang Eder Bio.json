The twenty-two-year-old student from Weinheim, Germany, says the inspiration for the deck came from trying to give the typical Goblin tribe something to do in the midgame. He achieved this by adding black to the deck for Patriarch's Bidding, which brings every Goblin in the graveyard back to play. And with cards like Goblin Warchief and Siege-Gang Commander, those Goblins have haste and bring friends with them! A resolved Patriarch's Bidding is usually game over.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc03","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2003","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/56f42feb-07f4-4fd6-a88b-33209de7de08","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc03&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc03?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/53b08fa1-f76a-407a-ba07-43cadc13453c/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3Afb3f0d13-f879-4d42-8093-b9c265e7852b&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"0645a083-9e19-43db-9e76-4a424d53895d","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"2003","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Wolfgang+Eder+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Wolfgang+Eder+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Wolfgang+Eder+Bio"}}
