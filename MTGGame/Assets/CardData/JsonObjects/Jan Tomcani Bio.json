Tomcani then proved that his run was no fluke by working his way up to the quarterfinals, where he lost to Alex Borteh in a close five-game match. Tomcani played a version of \"Fires,\" the green-red deck that defined much of this year's metagame. Tomcani's version, which splashed black, follows the normal Fires archetype of playing cheap creatures followed by Fires of Yavimaya and big creatures like Blastoderm or Spiritmonger.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc01","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2001","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/4d62d576-cf71-46e8-b0db-dfff03f36cb1","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc01&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc01?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/006a2cce-dd8f-47d5-aedd-135e51ecfa23/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3Aa5504345-e666-486b-9f45-f1e8fd23b3c5&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"0aeebaf5-8c7d-4636-9e82-8c27447861f7","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Jan+Tomcani+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Jan+Tomcani+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Jan+Tomcani+Bio"}}
