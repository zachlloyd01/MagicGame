Hacker said his deck was well set up to defeat his opponents with its twenty-something aggressive creatures—including a number of shadow and en-Kor creatures. Unlike traditional white weenie decks, which rely on Armageddon as a major threat card, Hacker's deck uses Cataclysm, which he feels better complements the use of Empyrial Armor.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc98","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1998","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/e8732c3a-160c-41da-bc79-5da86431b17d","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc98&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc98?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/a8d38af0-a960-4a49-9896-1e11f53eab5b/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3Aba589dd4-eccd-42b2-badf-f9f30a0c399d&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"df9a3149-dae5-4319-85bb-00d37c023360","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Brian+Hacker+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Brian+Hacker+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Brian+Hacker+Bio"}}
