The deck used blue not for countermagic, but for cards like Careful Study and Mental Note, which help the deck reach threshold more quickly, and for Wonder in the graveyard, which allows the deck's pumped-up threshold creatures to fly.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc02","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2002","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/04dfc9bb-ccaa-436c-b79a-925b2ad9bdbe","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc02&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc02?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/9464681a-9478-4f87-b22d-c32b9cbb0832/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A633b73de-cf85-41f0-acae-d8f67718a447&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"6bcbb89c-0af2-4510-8484-e59cc0042b09","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Raphael+Levy+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Raphael+Levy+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Raphael+Levy+Bio"}}
