This deck tried to get out lots of Squirrel tokens with Squirrel Nest before using Opposition to tie up the opponent's creatures and mana. Han How won quite a few games using some tricky sideboarding, such as pulling out his enchantments and bringing in more beatdown cards like Flametongue Kavu and Roar of the Wurm. Besides being a top MagicÂ® player, Han How is also a student at Bandar Utama College in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc02","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2002","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/04dfc9bb-ccaa-436c-b79a-925b2ad9bdbe","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc02&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc02?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/73bb5b31-d562-4c2f-af92-b995abb8d6eb/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A27414d58-0d34-40be-a3ac-eb04d32a92e0&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"6bcbb89c-0af2-4510-8484-e59cc0042b09","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Sim+Han+How+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Sim+Han+How+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Sim+Han+How+Bio"}}
