He has been with the Pro Tour since Atlanta '96 and has made the Top 8 three times (Mainz '97, Rome '98, and Worlds '99). Le Pine played an aggressive red deck called \"Sped Red.\" With his deck he applied pressure early with 11 fast creatures, then he'd shift into land-destruction mode with Wasteland, Stone Rain, Pillage, and Avalanche Riders. For the late game Le Pine used Cursed Scroll and Hammer of Bogardan to finish off his mana-crippled opponent.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc99","set_name":"World Championship Decks 1999","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/8bc653e3-56ce-4cd1-9590-a6134ec28b3a","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc99&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc99?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/3a959416-27be-4c92-ac4b-0404529ca978/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A6f0d897b-88ea-4119-909a-8a9564d04c15&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"407ed11d-7b6f-4e1c-ab00-f49c25f170e3","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Mark+Le+Pine+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Mark+Le+Pine+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Mark+Le+Pine+Bio"}}
