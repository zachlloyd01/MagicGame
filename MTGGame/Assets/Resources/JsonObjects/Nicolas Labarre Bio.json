This Rennes, France native played a combo deck that he called \"Chimera.\" This deck used searching cards like Academy Rector and Enlightened Tutor to fetch Fecundity, Saproling Cluster, and Ashnod's Altar. Once those three cards were in play, Labarre could generate as much mana as he wanted. With unlimited mana, he could play a very big Blaze or use Whetstone to immediately deck his opponent.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc00","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2000","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/632741a4-411d-4110-b507-5a5cfdd52ef2","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc00&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc00?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/260e570f-e86f-4c7f-ae69-c601de1405d8/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3A0ba72b8a-56aa-45be-9628-73825b506bba&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"056eb595-ee96-4682-9206-1eaba1e88719","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"1997","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Nicolas+Labarre+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Nicolas+Labarre+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Nicolas+Labarre+Bio"}}
