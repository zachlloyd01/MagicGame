With over $130,000 in career winnings and a Pro Tour championship on his resume, \"The Hump\" advanced to the Worlds semifinals for the second year in a row where he lost to eventual champion Daniel Zink. The blue-green madness deck he played has been a Standard mainstay for more than a year. It revolves around Torment madness cards like Basking Rootwalla and Circular Logic, together with discard-enablers like Aquamoeba and Wild Mongrel. Humpherys, who recently earned his Ph.D. from MIT, credits this version of the deck to Norway's Sigurd Eskeland.","colors":[],"color_identity":[],"legalities":{"standard":"not_legal","future":"not_legal","historic":"not_legal","pioneer":"not_legal","modern":"not_legal","legacy":"not_legal","pauper":"not_legal","vintage":"not_legal","penny":"not_legal","commander":"not_legal","brawl":"not_legal","duel":"not_legal","oldschool":"not_legal"},"games":[],"set":"wc03","set_name":"World Championship Decks 2003","set_type":"memorabilia","set_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/sets/56f42feb-07f4-4fd6-a88b-33209de7de08","set_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=set&q=e%3Awc03&unique=prints","scryfall_set_uri":"https://scryfall.com/sets/wc03?utm_source=api","rulings_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/2b490cfc-3a5a-4045-a53f-3395f61bb7a1/rulings","prints_search_uri":"https://api.scryfall.com/cards/search?order=released&q=oracleid%3Aee318996-f403-431a-862e-47329d25e027&unique=prints","rarity":"common","card_back_id":"0645a083-9e19-43db-9e76-4a424d53895d","artist":"","artist_ids":null,"illustration_id":null,"border_color":"gold","frame":"2003","edhrec_rank":0,"related_uris":{"tcgplayer_decks":"https://decks.tcgplayer.com/magic/deck/search?contains=Dave+Humpherys+Bio&page=1&partner=Scryfall&utm_campaign=affiliate&utm_medium=api&utm_source=scryfall","edhrec":"https://edhrec.com/route/?cc=Dave+Humpherys+Bio","mtgtop8":"https://mtgtop8.com/search?MD_check=1&SB_check=1&cards=Dave+Humpherys+Bio"}}
